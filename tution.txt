Azimuthal quantum number tells about the :

(1) Number of sub shells present in the main shells.

(2) The angular momentum of the electron present in any sub shell.

(3) The relative energies of the various sub shells.

(4) The shapes of the various sub shells present within the same principal Shell.

For a given value of n, it can have any integral value ranging from 0 to n-1.

For 1st Shell (K), n=1,  l can have only one value i.e., l=0

For the 2nd Shell (L), n=2, l can have two values  i.e. l=0 and 1

For the 3rd Shell ( M), n= 3, l can have three values i.e. l=0, 1, 2

For the 4th shells ( N ), n=4, l can have 4 values i.e. l=0, 1, 2, 3

Depending upon the values of l, i.e. l = 0, 1, 2 and 3,the different sub shells  
are designated as s,p,d and f .These notations are the initial letters of the words, sharp, principal, diffused
 and fundamental formerly used to describe different spectral lines.
